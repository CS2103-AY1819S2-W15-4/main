<p>MINDEF Duty Planner is a platform to assist military units in the SAF in the assignment of daily duties amongst the servicemen. The application is optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). The software is designed to automate the process of fairly assigning duties to available servicemen for an entire month. It also enables servicemen to conveniently indicate the days they are unavailable for duty. It seeks to fairly distribute duties by taking into account the varying importance of each duty (e.g. Sunday duties are worth more than weekday duties).</p>

<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Major enhancement</strong>: Added the ability to request swapping of duties (using the 'swap' command), respond to swap requests (using the 'acceptSwap' command), view paired swaps (using the 'viewSwaps' command) and approve or reject swap requests (using the 'approveSwap' or 'rejectSwap' command).</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>What it does: allows a user who is a particular person in the personnel database to request for a swap of his duty with another person&#8217;s duty. Both duties have to be in the next month.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Justification: This feature is very useful for a serviceman who is suddenly unavailable to perform guard duty due to ad hoc reasons. He can broadcast his swap request onto the app in the large panel on the bottom right and other servicemen can view his request and respond if they are willing and able to swap with him. After that, an admin user will approve or reject the swap.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Highlights: This functionality is very convenient for the users because it requires no verbal communication at all and the process is completely streamlined to be performed on the app. Physical or verbal communication is only necessary if there are disputes. This enhancement involves changes in logic (commands), UI (browser panel), storage (storing of requests) and model (structure of requests). Implementing this feature required understanding how and when saving to a json file happens so as to trigger the save event when needed. It was also difficult to convert the browser panel from an object that displays web pages to a text object, having no prior experience in GUI.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Credits: <em>Valavan for the idea of swap requests and my team for helping me to develop the idea</em></p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Minor enhancement</strong>: Converted the Person class to one suitable for the duty planner. This means removing the email and address fields (which are classes in themselves) and adding in Company, Section, Rank and NRIC. This was very time-consuming, especially with having to adapt all the tests involving Person objects with no exception. We could theoretically have done away with the individual classes for each field but I decided to preserve the existing structure to reduce complications after analysis of the trade-offs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Minor enhancement</strong>: Morphed the browser panel to display the list of open swap requests (i.e swap requests that are awaiting response) instead of a website.</p>

<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="current-implementation"><a class="link" href="#current-implementation">Current Implementation</a></h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Swap Request Creation</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There is currently a Java class called Request in the request folder in the model package. This request represents a swap request that a duty personnel submits using the 'swap' command. It has 4 fields, the requester Person object, the allocated date (out of which the requester wants to swap) as a java.time.LocalDate object, the requested date (into which the requester wants to swap) also as a LocalDate object, and the accepter Person object, which could be null.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A Request object is created when the 'swap' command is entered by a non-master-admin user. Since he is an actual human user with an associated Person object and NRIC, he is able to request a swap if he is unwilling or unable to do his current allocated duty. This must happen after the duties are scheduled. Otherwise, the list of duties associated with the user is empty and a swap request cannot be made.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The swap command is wrapped in a SwapCommand object that extends the abstract class Command, just like any other command. The user inputs 2 dates, his allocated and requested date, and the 2 dates are parsed as LocalDate objects, from which the Request object is made.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Thereafter, the Request object is added to the personnel database through the model so the personnel database now contains the request in a list.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>After this, the new personnel database is committed (making it undoable) and the listener in LogicManager is informed. As a result, the new personnel database is saved into the JSON file. Finally, the browser panel is refreshed to reflect the newest request list.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The browser panel was transformed from implementing FXML WebView to FXML TextArea. After the request list is updated, a new string is passed to the TextArea field for it to display in the browser panel.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Accept Swap Command</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Next, there is a command 'acceptSwap' that allows a non-master-admin user to accept a swap that another user has requested (we call this an open swap.) The list of open swaps would be on the list in the browser panel and the 'acceptSwap' command takes in a positive integer as argument and this integer refers to the index number of the request in the request list.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Again, this is encapsulated in an AcceptSwapCommand object, which extends the abstract Command class. An AcceptSwapCommand constructor takes in the index mentioned above and the username (i.e NRIC) of the current user. It sets the accepter Person in the relevant Request object to be the current user.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>View Swaps Command</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The 'viewSwaps' command is only for admin users. It takes in no arguments and it is for admin users to view all the swap requests which have found an accepter (From now on we call these paired requests.) This command is encapsulated in the ViewSwapsCommand object. When this ViewSwapsCommand object is executed by the LogicManager, a string showing all the paired requests pending approval is generated and passed into the TextArea of the ResultDisplay. This allows the admin user to view the requests and then proceed to approve or reject them.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Approve / Reject Swap Command</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The admin user can then use 'approveSwap' or 'rejectSwap' to approve or reject a paired swap in the list displayed in the ResultDisplay after executing the viewSwaps command. These are encapsulated in the ApproveSwapCommand and RejectSwapCommand classes.</p>
