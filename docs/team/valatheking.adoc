== Summary of contributions

** What it does: Allows the user to block dates of duty for the upcoming month allowing them not to be scheduled for duties on those particular days
** Justification: This features allows personnel to have some flexibility on the days the do duties and to ensure that they can attend other events or not do duties when they are busy 
** Highlights: This enhancement affected the scheduling algorithm and the algorithm and Duty system had to be modified to allow personnel to block Dates
** Credits: Thanks to my other group members for helping to figure out the block date command
